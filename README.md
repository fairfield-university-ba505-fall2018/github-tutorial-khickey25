# The purpose
The purpose of this tutorial was to _learn_ how to navigate around github, github desktop, and atom.
I even learned how to write in markdown as a text editing method on atom, and now I can do cool things, like create a link that I am supposed to do: [link to Github file](https://github.com/fairfield-university-ba505-fall2018/github-tutorial-khickey25/blob/master/README.md)
Ta-da!
